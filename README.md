# ProjectFlashcards
This React app allows users to create, view, study, and edit decks of flashcards. Each card in a deck has two sides and, when studied, can be flipped to show either side. I completed this project to learn more about building CRUD applications, and have used it to study concepts of front-end development.

Tech: HTML, CSS, Javascript with React
